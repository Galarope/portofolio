### Description

A personal portofolio, designed using reactJS. Used to display and present all my projects as a web developer.

### Install

Make sure that Node.JS and NPM are both installed on your device. You can now open a new terminal and use the command line : npm install -g create-react-app .

Once this is done, let's start a new project, use the terminal command create-react-app my-app and replace the "my-app" by the name you want your project to be called.

You now need to change de directory by typing the command "cd my-app" (do not forget to replace de "my-app" by the name of your project once again).

You can now start the development server with the command npm start.
